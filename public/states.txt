State is simillar to props, but it is private and fully comtrolled by the component . We can create state only in class 
component.It is posible to update the state/Modify state

its only in class component not in function component
props are not Modify and states are modified

there are 2 ways  to initialise state in React
1. Inside class
2. Inside constructor
