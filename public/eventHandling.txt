these are Javascript events

handling event in React element is simillar to handling event in DOM element

React events are camelCase and not lowercase

this will not work with event function so use arraow function or use bind in constructor to bind this to event handler function
 you can not return false to prevent dafault behaviour in react.You must have to call preventDefault explicitly
