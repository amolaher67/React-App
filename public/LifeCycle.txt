Compoenent process
1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Error HAndling
4. Unmounting

The followring method are called in the following order when instance of Compoenent is being created and inserted
into DOM

1. constructor (Mounting) - It is called before it is mounted. When when we use constructor in component class ,
                 first statement should before be super(props) .Otherwise this.props will be undefined,
                 which can lead bugs


2. static getDerivedStateFromProps() - )Mounting,Updating - new props, setState(), forceUpdate()
3. render() -  return react element (jsx) - get called whenever state changes
4. componentDidMount() - when mounting already done then, this method get called
5. GetSnapShopShotBeforeUpdate() - forceUpdate
6. componentDidUpdate() - Update - Final Event called when update done
7. componentWillUnmount() - called just before component gets removed
